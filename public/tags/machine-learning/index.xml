      <description>PyMC3 is a Python package for probabilistic machine learning that enables users to build bespoke models for their specific problems using a probabilistic modeling framework. However, PyMC3 lacks the steps between creating a model and reusing it with new data in production. The missing steps include: scoring a model, saving a model for later use, and loading the model in production systems. In contrast, scikit-learn which has become the standard library for machine learning provides a simple API that makes it very easy for users to train, score, save and load models in production.</description>
